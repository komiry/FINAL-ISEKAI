            Greetings from the web universe! 🚀 With 1 year of front-end wizardry under my belt, I'm on a mission to make the digital world a better place—one pixel at a time. 💻 You see, I'm not your average developer. I'm the kind who turns coffee into code and ideas into interactive web experiences. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are my trusty sidekicks, and I've even tamed the wild beasts called React and Vue.js. 🦄 But here's the twist—I'm not just about serious coding.
        </p>
        <p>
            I bring enthusiasm, a pinch of humor, and a dash of creativity to every project. Collaborating with me is like having a web adventure partner who's as serious about meeting deadlines as cracking jokes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the grand quest for pixel perfection, I champion accessibility, making sure everyone has a smooth ride on the internet highway. 🌐 Ready to embark on this web journey together? Let's make some magic happen! ✨ Overall, I love Komi Can't Comminucate, Erase, and Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid.

            As a weeb, my 🤩 journey into the world 🌍 of anime 🥑 began when I was a young teen. Back then, I was only interested in the popular shounen anime like One Piece(⁠◕⁠ᴗ⁠◕⁠✿⁠) and Black Clover🍀. However, soon after, I stumbled onto lesser-known series like Vinland Saga🤝🏿 and Death Note💀, which opened up a whole new realm of anime genres and storytelling. 🧩 As I delved deeper into the anime realm, I discovered that my tastes were more diverse than I initially thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began to appreciate the unique art styles 🎨 and storytelling 📺 of each series, as well as the rich cultures surrounding the anime and manga community. 😊 Over time, I have come to realize that anime is about so much more than just action and adventure(⁠ㆁ⁠ω⁠ㆁ⁠); it's a medium that tackles serious social and philosophical issues in a way that is accessible and engaging to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            📚 Whether it's the intricate world-building of One Piece or the introspective journey of Mushishi, I am constantly reminded of the power of anime to transport us to new and fascinating worlds, while also inviting us to reflect on our own lives. 🛤️ As a life-time student of the art, I am constantly exploring new anime and｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡ discovering the many different ways in which it can inspire and enrich our lives<⁠(⁠￣⁠︶⁠￣⁠)⁠>.
