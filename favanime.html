                    Kobayashi is a bespectacled young woman with bright red hair that is always tied in a ponytail with some bangs let down and dead fish hazel brown eyes (by Tohru). She is known to be flat-chested, a physical trait that frustrates her to the point of grumbling over the female dragons' ample busts when they are in their human forms. In one of her drunken escapades, she demands that Tohru or Lucoa share some of their "blessing" with her.</span>

                    Satoru is a quiet, sometimes cynical person who is not very good at conversing with others and prefers to keep to himself. Although he can be caring, he tends to keep his thoughts superficial and brusque, because--as he explains--he is afraid to deeply examine his own heart and feelings.</span>
